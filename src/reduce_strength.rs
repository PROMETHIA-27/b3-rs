/// Does strength reduction, constant folding, canonicalization, CFG simplification, DCE, and very

/// dramatically reduce the complexity of the code. In the future, it's preferable to add optimizations
/// to this phase rather than creating new optimizations because then the optimizations can participate
/// in the fixpoint. However, because of the many interlocking optimizations, it can be difficult to
/// add sophisticated optimizations to it. For that reason we have full CSE in a different phase, for
/// example.
pub fn reduce_strength(_proc: &mut Procedure) {}

// The goal of this phase is to:
//
// - Replace operations with less expensive variants. This includes constant folding and classic
//   strength reductions like turning Mul(x, 1 << k) into Shl(x, k).
//
// - Reassociate constant operations. For example, Load(Add(x, c)) is turned into Load(x, offset = c)
//   and Add(Add(x, c), d) is turned into Add(x, c + d).
//
// - Canonicalize operations. There are some cases where it's not at all obvious which kind of
//   operation is less expensive, but it's useful for subsequent phases - particularly LowerToAir -
//   to have only one way of representing things.
//
// This phase runs to fixpoint. Therefore, the canonicalizations must be designed to be monotonic.
// For example, if we had a canonicalization that said that Add(x, -c) should be Sub(x, c) and
// another canonicalization that said that Sub(x, d) should be Add(x, -d), then this phase would end
// up running forever. We don't want that.
//
// Therefore, we need to prioritize certain canonical forms over others. Naively, we want strength
// reduction to reduce the number of values, and so a form involving fewer total values is more
// canonical. But we might break this, for example when reducing strength of Mul(x, 9). This could be
// better written as Add(Shl(x, 3), x), which also happens to be representable using a single
// instruction on x86.
//
// Here are some of the rules we have:
//
// Canonical form of logical not: BitXor(value, 1). We may have to avoid using this form if we don't
// know for sure that 'value' is 0-or-1 (i.e. returnsBool). In that case we fall back on
// Equal(value, 0).
//
// Canonical form of commutative operations: if the operation involves a constant, the constant must
// come second. Add(x, constant) is canonical, while Add(constant, x) is not. If there are no
// constants then the canonical form involves the lower-indexed value first. Given Add(x, y), it's
// canonical if x->index() <= y->index().
